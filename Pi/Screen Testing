3.5" TFT/LCD 480x320 using SPI connection.  uses LCD-show driver
    Raspberry Pi 4 or 5?
        Only tested on Pi4 4Gb with basic heatsink and fan.  Fan is attached to back of LCD screen.  Attempted to add a second fan for extra cooling but there was not enough space.
    OS with full functionality: 
        Kali, Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu Mate
    Touch Response? 1.5/5
        Ok when using stylus.  Terrible when trying to select anything within .5 cm from the edge of the screen. 
    Does the screen require editing the config.txt?
        Yes.  Requires LCD-show driver.  You must choose the correct driver otherwise things will not work correctly.  Make sure to set the rotation.
            #Enable driver
            sudo rm -rf LCD-show
            git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
            chmod -R 755 LCD-show
            cd LCD-show
            sudo ./LCD35-show

            #Touchscreen calibration
            cd LCD-show/
            sudo dpkg -i -B xinput-calibration_0.7.5-1_armhf.deb  #or your current version

            #Disable driver
            cd LCD-show/
            sudo ./LCD-hdmi
    Does the Raspberry Pi Camera Module work?
        Limited room and screen has heat issues.  The tested distros ran into issues after attempting to run updates and only Raspberry Pi OS was able to push past update restrictions.  This later caused crashing.
    Does Pinns or multiboot work? 
        Absolutely not.
    Interaction with 3rd party peripherals. Webcam/Drawing tablet?
        Webcam works but is slow.  Drawing tablet not tested
    Screen Blanking?
        No
    Video Playback and framerate?
        Video playback was steady at lower resolutions.  Anything past 720p causes slow downs and frame drops.
    Audio working? 
        Yes but there is a slight delay.
    Does Dual Screen work?  Do you have to have the second screen plugged in on boot?
        No Dual screen.  The LCD-show driver requires you to set the driver type.  Either on or off.  No option to use SPI driver and micro-HDMI out.

        Yes on Raspbian distros (Raspberry Pi OS, Lee2KDE, Parrot OS) fixed by disabling 'screen blanking' in Raspi-config and changing audio output to HDMI  
    Video Playback and framerate?
        Once the screen blanking issue is addressed you will be able to run videos from youtube at 1080p with no issues.  For best performance use a BT headset
    Audio working? 
        Yes.  Screen has built in speakers.  Audio is pushed through HDMI.
    Does Dual Screen work?  Do you have to have the second screen plugged in on boot?
        Yes.  MX and PopOS are the only ones that did not require a restart and properly detects new displays as they are connected.  The HDMI connector to the screen slightly blocks the second HDMI port so you will need a skinny adapter to dual screen. 

5" LCD from Microcenter 800x480
    Raspberry Pi 4 or 5?
        Fully functional on Pi4.  Untested on Pi5
    OS with full functionality:
        Raspberry Pi OS, MX Linux, Kali, Parrot OS, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu 
    Touch Response? 2.5
        Ok when using stylus.  Accuracy is off by a couple mm even after adjusting hdmi_cvt values and running Touchcsreen configuration.
    Does the screen require editing the config.txt?
        No.  Can be used without editing Config.txt but changing the hdmi_timings or hdmi_cvt values will help the OS identify the odd 800x480 resolution.  
    Does the Raspberry Pi Camera Module work?
        Yes.  MX Linux and Ubuntu run sudo apt install libcamera-apps 
    Does Pinns or multiboot work?
        Well yes but actually No.  800x480 is too low a resolution for the Pinns boot screen to display.  While you can install Pinns and distros through it you will need an external monitor with 720p or higher resolution to access the Pinns boot screen.
    Interaction with 3rd party peripherals. Webcam/Drawing tablet.
        Fully functional
    Screen Blanking?
        No
    Video Playback and framerate?
        Video works well under 720p.  Anything higher causes frame drops. Plays Sega Dreamcast games at 30FPS 
    Audio working?  
        Yes.
    Does Dual Screen work?  Do you have to have the second screen plugged in on boot?
        Yes.
    Notes
        Screen resolution cannot be set below 800x400.  This will cause the screen to "white out"
