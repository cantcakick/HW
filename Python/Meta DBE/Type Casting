# Using explicit type conversion, change the following 
# inputs so the types match with the following below

# name = type string

# on the price of the items - the price is determined by you. The output
# should print the total of the 3 inputs rounded to 2 decimal places e.g
#

#   1 sandwich @ $ 4.99
#   1 cake @ $ 2.75
